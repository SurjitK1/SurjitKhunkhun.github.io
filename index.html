        I am an Information technology student at York University studying in the Faculty of Liberal Arts & Professional Studies. Hoping one day to break into Cybersecurity as a promising career. Some of my favorite hobbies are going to the gym lifting weights, watching anime, trying different restaurants, and playing various sports with friends.
